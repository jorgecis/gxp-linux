===============================================
Device Tree for I2C slave message queue backend
===============================================

Some protocols over I2C/SMBus are designed for bi-directional transferring
messages by using I2C Master Write protocol. This requires that both sides
of the communication have slave addresses.

This I2C slave mqueue (message queue) is used to receive and queue
messages from the remote i2c intelligent device; and it will add the target
slave address (with R/W# bit is always 0) into the message at the first byte.

Required Properties:
- compatible		: should be "i2c-slave-mqueue"
- reg			: slave address

Example:

i2c {
	slave_mqueue: i2c-slave-mqueue {
		compatible = "i2c-slave-mqueue";
		reg = <0x10>;
	};
};
